# Furhat Dungeon Master
Computer Engineering Senior Design Project

## Abstract 
In our project, we aimed to program Furhat, which is a social robot that can interact with people easily
by projecting different faces and making gestures, into a game moderator in a turn-based role-playing
game whose scenario is based on Koç University. We aimed to have a game that consists of several
mini-games that proceed by using computer vision and/or audio inputs. Furthermore, Furhat would
give feedback to the players or hints about the game by observing players’ emotional states to make
the game as entertaining as possible.

Our main game includes 5 mini-games: Rock-Paper-Scissor, Escape from a Maze, Quiz, Chess, and
Emotion. For interactions with Furhat to be more natural, we not only use auditorial inputs, but also
utilize visual inputs using the external cameras from the players in each mini-game. The scenario
itself was created and embedded in these mini-games, furthermore a game management system is
created to connect the story and the mini-games. Additionally, we have added a rotating hand to the
hardware system to increase players’ engagement. The players can go through the game with their
desired choice of strategy and play these games while keeping track of their stats in the game.
