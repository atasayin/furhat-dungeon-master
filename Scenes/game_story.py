story = 'In a university far far away, too many parents have buried the umbilical cords of their children into the fields of a university with the hope that their children can study there someday. This DNA cocktail, after being struck by lighting, resulted in creation of a sentient being made out of umbilical cords. This being has taken over a university, with the sole purpose of receiving as much ERC grants as possible. In order to achieve this goal, it closed down student clubs, shut down the gym and started "mandated proposal writing sessions". Under the dictator\'s oppressive rule, the once peaceful institution has become a place of fear and intimidation. As a member of the rebellion, it will be your duty to stand against this injustice and fight for freedom. You will join forces with other rebels, each with their own unique abilities, as you strategize and execute a plan to defeat the umbilical cord tyrant. But be warned, the enemy will not go down without a fight. You may face intense battles and difficult challenges as you struggle to overthrow their rule. The rebellion needs a leader to guide them through these perilous times. Will you rise to the challenge and become the hero of the rebellion, or will you succumb to the darkness? The fate of the university rests on your shoulders. But do not lose hope. The rebellion has already gained support from many who have grown tired of living under the tyrannical rule of the umbilical cord dictator. With courage and determination, you can rally others to your cause and lead the charge against the oppression. Will you emerge victorious and bring peace back to the university, or will the umbilical cord tyrant continue to spread their reign of terror across the university? The choice is yours in "Furhat, The Dungeon Master".'
